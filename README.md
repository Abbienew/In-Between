# In-Between

《In Between》 is based on the work "Song of Sea Waves" , an art of marine project, for transfering of the causes behind the sea surface waves, taking data and models for creating a conversion of sea surface waves, creating an interactive installation for audience to understand the spatial-temporal information between sonification sound and sea surface waves
